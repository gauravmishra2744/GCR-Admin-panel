# Setup Instructions

To resolve the current errors and get the site working, please follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the following command to install the newly added dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. After the installation is complete, start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The site should now compile successfully and run without the previous errors. The AdminLayout component will work correctly with:
- The antd components (Layout, Menu, Input, Badge, Avatar, Dropdown)
- The ant-design icons
- The Footer component

Note: You may see npm funding and vulnerability messages. To address the vulnerabilities, you can run:
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```
However, be cautious with the --force flag as it might update packages to versions that could introduce breaking changes. It's recommended to review the changes before applying them.
