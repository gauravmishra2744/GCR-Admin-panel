# Solution for Webpack/Antd Source Map Warnings and ESLint Errors

## Source Map Warnings
The warnings about failing to parse source maps for antd components are common and don't affect functionality. These warnings occur because webpack is trying to parse source maps for less files that aren't directly accessible. To suppress these warnings, you can:

1. Add a `webpack.config.js` to your project and configure source-map-loader to ignore antd files:
```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        enforce: 'pre',
        loader: 'source-map-loader',
        options: {
          filterSourceMappingUrl: (url, resourcePath) => {
            return !resourcePath.includes('node_modules/antd/');
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

2. Or simply ignore these warnings as they don't impact the application's functionality.

## ESLint Errors in NewHeader.js
The ESLint errors in NewHeader.js need to be fixed by:
1. Moving all imports to the top of the file
2. Removing unused imports
3. Organizing imports properly

I will fix these issues in the NewHeader.js file in the next iteration.
