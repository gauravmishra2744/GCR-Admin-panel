## Solution for Missing Dependencies

The error indicates that the required npm packages are not installed, even though they are correctly listed in package.json.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in your project directory
2. Run the following command to install the missing dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will install all dependencies listed in package.json, including:
- antd (^5.5.0)
- @ant-design/icons (^5.1.0)

After the installation completes, restart your development server with:
```bash
npm start
```

The compilation errors should now be resolved.
